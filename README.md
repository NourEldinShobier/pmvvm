<p align="center">
  A clean & simple MVVM architecture for state management that uses Provider & Hooks under the hood. This package adopts some concepts from Stacked package, but with much simpler & cleaner approach.
</p>

# How does it work ‚öôÔ∏è
3 major pieces are needed, everything else is up to you. These pieces are:

- **View**: It represents the UI of the application devoid of any Application Logic. The `ViewModel` sends notifications to the `view` to update the UI whenever state changes.
- **ViewModel**: It acts as a bridge between the `Model` and the `View`. It‚Äôs responsible for transforming the data from the `Model`, it also holds the events of the `View`
- **Model**: Holds app data and the business logic. It consists of the business logic - local and remote data source, model classes, repository. They‚Äôre usually simple classes.

### Advantages ‚úîÔ∏è

- Your code is even more easily testable.
- Your code is further decoupled (the biggest advantage.)
- The package structure is even easier to navigate.
- The project is even easier to maintain.
- Your team can add new features even more quickly.

### When to use it üëå
To keep it simple, use the `MVVM` whenever your widget has its own events that can mutate the state directly e.g: pages, posts, ..etc.

**Some Notes**
- `View` can't access the `Model` directly
- `View` is devoid of any application logic
- `ViewModel` has only one `View` whether it was a page, post, ..etc.

# Usage üë®‚Äçüíª
Let's look at the code:

**1.** Build your `ViewModel`.
```dart
class MyViewModel extends ViewModel {
  int counter = 0;

  // Optional
  @override
  void init() {
    // It's called after the ViewModel is constructed
  }

  // Optional
  @override
  void build() {
    // It's called everytime the view is rebuilt
  }

  void increase() {
    counter++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```
You can also access the `context` inside the `ViewModel` directly
```dart
class MyViewModel extends ViewModel {
  @override
  void init() {
    var height = MediaQuery.of(context).size.height;
  }
}
```
**2.** Declare `MVVM` inside your widget.
```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MVVM<MyViewModel>(
      view: (context, vmodel) => _MyView(),
      viewModel: () => MyViewModel(),
    );
  }
}
```
**3.** Build your `View`.
```dart
// HookView

class _MyView extends HookView<MyViewModel> {
  /// Set [reactive] to [false] if you don't want the view to listen to the ViewModel.
  /// It's [true] by default.
  const _MyView({Key key}) : super(key: key, reactive: true); 

  @override
  Widget render(context, vmodel) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        Text(vmodel.counter.toString()),
        SizedBox(height: 24),
        RaisedButton(onPressed: vmodel.increase, child: Text('Increase')),
      ],
    );
  }
}

// OR: StatelessView

class _MyView extends StatelessView<MyViewModel> {
  /// Set [reactive] to [false] if you don't want the view to listen to the ViewModel.
  /// It's [true] by default.
  const _MyView({Key key}) : super(key: key, reactive: true); 

  @override
  Widget render(context, vmodel) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        Text(vmodel.counter.toString()),
        SizedBox(height: 24),
        RaisedButton(onPressed: vmodel.increase, child: Text('Increase')),
      ],
    );
  }
```
If you want to use less boilerplate, you can use `MVVMWidget` instead of the `MVVM` builder.
```dart
class _MyView extends MVVMWidget<MyViewModel> {
  const _MyView({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget view(context, vmodel) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        Text(vmodel.counter.toString()),
        SizedBox(height: 24),
        RaisedButton(onPressed: vmodel.increase, child: Text('Increase')),
      ],
    );
  }

  @override
  MyViewModel viewModel() => MyViewModel();
}
```

# Notes üéØ
- You can call the `init` method only one time, by setting the `initOnce` of the `MVVM` builder or the `MVVMWidget` to `true`
- You can use `context.fetch<T>()` which is equivalent to `Provider.of<T>(context)`
- `example` project contains counter & firebase 2 factor authentication

# FAQ ü§î
- What is the difference between `Stacked` & `P.MVVM` since both adopts the same principles?

| **Stacked**                                                                                                                                                               | **P.MVVM**                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You can't access the `BuildContext` from the `ViewModel`.                                                                                                                         | `BuildContext` can be accessed inside the `ViewModel` using:<br><br>1. `Provider.of<T>(context)`<br>2. `context.watch<T>()`<br>3. `context.read<T>()`<br>4. `context.select<T, R>(R cb(T value))`                     |
| You should implement the `Initialisable` interface to call `initialise`.                                                                                                  | `init` method is called by default, all you need to do is to override it **(optional)**.                                                                                                                          |
| There is no `build` method in the `ViewModel`.                                                                                                                            | `build` method is called by default every time the `View` is rebuilt, and you can override it to implement yours **(optional)**.                                                                                  |
| It over-wraps `provider` with many `ViewModels` like `FutureViewModel`, `StreamViewModel`, ‚Ä¶etc. Which `provider` & `flutter_hooks` are built to do without any wrapping. | It doesn‚Äôt over-wrap `provider` package with such classes. Instead, you can use `StreamProvider/FutureProvider` or `Hooks` which gives you the flexibility to make the most out of  `provider` & `flutter_hooks`. |
| It has **reactive & non-reactive** constructors that force developers to use consumer in a specific position in the sub-tree.                                             | It doesn‚Äôt have such concepts, all you need is to declare the `MVVM` and consume it from anywhere in the sub-tree.                                                                                                |

In summary, P.MVVM is simpler & cleaner, there is no over-wrapping, and idioms are more clear.
